# Why Steem? 

<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/steem">Steem</a> is a form of <i>esteem</i> which means to set a high value on or to prize.  

In the 14th-16th century it meant value. Steem is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homophone">homophone</a> for steam 
which is frequently associated with power. It only seemed right for a cryptocurrency to be associated with value and power. 


# Is Steem a Micropayment Platform?

**No.** While it is possible for users to pay and/or tip one another, that is now how Steem
rewards posts and curation. [Micropayments don't work.](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/2010-11/MicropaymentsAndTheNet/issues.html)

Steem bypasses micropayments completely. When a user upvotes a post, the community 
pays the bill. The same amount of money will be spent whether the user upvotes a post or not 
and the funds will not come from the voter.  

> **A transaction cannot simultaneously be worth enough to warrant a decision and worth so little that the decision is automatic. The only transactions that users can approve without thought are ones that cost them nothing.**

Under Steem, rewards are paid to content producers *and* curators (voters), But the costs are not 
born by those who vote for the content.  The costs are paid for by creating new STEEM and those 
with voting power have vesting stake that is likely earning a positive inflation-adjusted 
rate of return. Someone can join the system, vote to pay someone, and then exit the system 
with more money than they started with (assuming the market valuation of the STEEM system 
remained constant). In other words, the reward solution used by Steem produces 
a user-experience similar to many widely used websites that have user-moderated content.

# Who pays all of the rewards?

All rewards are paid by the network, this is not a micropayment platform. 

# Why doesn't Steem make readers, posters, or voters pay?

The community benefits more from every user interaction than any individual. When 
one person takes the effort to post something as simple as cat picture, many people 
benefit from sharing the experience. Posting a cat picture takes effort and incurs an 
opportunity cost on the poster. Their reward for sharing is positive feedback from 
others who liked the content.  It is fair to say that the value of positive feedback 
is worth so little on its own that the poster would rarely pay anything to share. 
The same equation holds true for those who get to see the cat picture. The value of 
that individual experience is so low that the mental cost of choosing to pay or tip 
the poster is greater than the value of even the cutest cat picture.

# How does Steem pay for everything?

Centralized social media such as Facebook and Twitter convert user contributions 
into billions of dollars for shareholders. Steem is a decentralized platform that 
introduces a new approach to financially incentivise users to contribute and curate 
content without the pitfalls of micropayments or ads. What makes Steem unique is that 
it recognizes that the combination of individual user contributions is worth much more 
than the sum of the individual contributions. Steem can pay for unlimited individual 
contributions with a share in the whole because the cost of an individual contribution 
is much less than the value it adds to the whole. The secret is in voting algorithms 
that are resistant to harmful manipulation.

A group of people can produce more by working together than the combined product of 
the same group members working individually. An individual contribution to a social 
network is worthless on its own, but the combined value of all user interactions is 
worth billions of dollars. If you take the $300 billion value of Facebook and divide 
it by the total number of shares and likes per year then you end up with an average 
value of $0.20 per user interaction. Imagine how many more people would contribute 
to Facebook if they were getting paid $0.20 per like?

# Is STEEM extremely inflationary?

**No**. Long-term holders who vest their STEEM earn a positive inflation-adjusted
rate of return anytime less than 90% of the market capitalization is vesting. Relative to
the total supply, STEEM "inflates" at about 12% per year which is less than Bitcoin and
other popular currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum inflated in excess of 20% per
year at first and continue to inflate at over 8% per year. 

While the virtual inflation rate is about 12% APR, the effective inflation rate is far less
because half of all rewards are paid out as STEEM Dollars. There is no rush to cash out
STEEM Dollars and their issuance does not create as much sell pressure on STEEM. In many cases the
STEEM Dollars will never get converted to STEEM. As the network grows, STEEM Dollars convert
to less and less STEEM which ultimately reduces the effective inflation rate.

# Is STEEM Socialist / Communist? 

**No**. STEEM takes a very capitalistic approach. Every user brings capital to the network
in the form of human labor, savings, investment, and speculation. The value of each user's
contribution is assessed by the community and they are awarded their pro-rata share of the
STEEM.

# What is a STEEM Dollar?

A STEEM Dollar can be converted to $1.00 worth of STEEM based upon a decentralized
price feed produced elected individuals.

# How do I convert STEEM Dollar's to dollars in my bank?

The short answer: sell the STEEM dollars to someone looking to buy STEEM dollars. 
The long answer: transfer your STEEM dollars to a crypto-currency exchange, sell them for
dollars, and ask the exchange to wire transfer dollars to your account.

# Where does Interest on STEEM Dollars come from?

**Short Answer**: Steem creates new STEEM Dollars to pay interest on existing STEEM Dollars. 

**Long Answer**: Long term STEEM holders pay interest in exchange for increasing the leverage on their STEEM. 

# How is the Interest rate on STEEM dollars determined? 

Elected block producers set the Interest rate according to the desire of vesting STEEM holders. The
rate is determined to maximize the value of STEEM. High initial rates are used to attract capital and
compensate for the risk of early adopters. Eventually the interest rate will be adjusted to maintain 
a balance in the debt to equity ratio and support the market demand for STEEM Dollars.

# Why does Steem pay people to vote?

Short answer: because votes add significant value to content.

The Internet would lose the vast majority of its value if all links among content were removed. 
It is the relationship among web pages that allows Google to identify the best apple pie recipe 
among the 16 million results.  Without the links the only information Google would have is word frequency.

Links can take many forms and have adapted over time. Every time a user votes on content in a social 
network they add a link between themselves and the content.  This in turn links the consumer to the 
producer through the content. The more links a network has the more valuable the information becomes. 

It is the relative and intentional connectedness of information that gives it value.

A social network can maximize the value extracted from a set of content by maximizing the quantity and 
quality of links. Curating content is expensive and time consuming while being near impossible for 
computers to perform in the absence of links. Steem rewards users who are among the first to find 
and link to new content.

# Is Steem Proof of Work?

*Yes*. The Steem network is secured by two kinds of proof of work. The first is traditional CPU mining, and
the second is long-term commitment of capital. On average, a block is produced by a CPU miner every 42 seconds. In
between blocks produced by CPU miners, blocks are produced every 2 seconds by elected miners. Only vesting STEEM 
can vote on miners.

# Is Steem Proof of Stake?

*Yes*. Every transaction signed by any user references a recent block. The result is a network secured by
Transactions as Proof of Stake. Some people may consider vesting STEEM to be a form of Proof of Stake.

# Is my data kept private?

Steem is a public blockchain. All posts, votes, and balances are public. A future update to Steem may enable 
confidential transfers of STEEM or STEEM Dollars, but confidential balances will not earn interest.

# Where is data stored?

All posts are kept on the blockchain. Future versions may reference [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) as a storage medium.

# Do I have to pay taxes?

We cannot give tax advice, but in general you are responsible as an individual taxpayer to calculate what 
you owe. You're expected to voluntarily comply with the tax code by reporting what you owe to the government 
and paying the entire amount that you owe under the law. 

# Is STEEM an investment?

Depends upon *your* point of view. We do not advise anyone to view STEEM as an investment. STEEM is a crypto
currency secured by proof of work on a public ledger. The [IRS has ruled crypto currencies to be property for
tax purposes.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-25/bitcoin-is-property-not-currency-in-tax-system-irs-says). 
This means that if you make money buying low and selling high then you may have to pay capital gains tax.

STEEM is not a share in Steemit, Inc nor does it grant the holder any rights over anyone else or their property.

# Is STEEM a security? 

**NO**. STEEM does not create any contractual obligations between parties. It is an accounting artifact on a public
ledger whose value is determined by the market. Do not buy STEEM with the expectation that Steemit, Inc owes you
anything. Specifically, Steemit, Inc reserves the right to stop all software development, shutdown all servers, stop
all support, and cease any other operations. All software is provided AS IS without warranty.

An additional $200,000 SCD was allocated to the initial developers as compensation for development.

# Can Steem Scale to the Size of major Social Media Platforms?

Reddit users generate the equivalent of 225 transactions per second. Twitter averages 6000 tweets per second. Facebook averages 50,000 likes per second. 
Steem is built on software capable of processing over 50,000 transactions per second with the necessary hardware and internet connection. It can easily
handle 225 transactions per second generated by Reddit on commodity hardware and data center quality internet connection.

# How much are miners paid?

1% of the market capitalization is paid to block producers every year. At the size of Bitcoin this amounts to $5 million dollars per month. At the same
scale $250,000 per month is paid to CPU miners.

# Is Steem legal?

To the best of our knowledge, crypto currencies have not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as exchanges.

Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.

# Is Steem a Ponzi scheme?
A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money, or the money paid by subsequent investors, instead of from profit earned by the individuals running the business. Ponzi schemes are designed to collapse at the expense of the last investors when there is not enough new participants.

Steem is a free software project with no central authority. Consequently, no one is in a position to make fraudulent representations about investment returns. Like other major currencies such as gold, United States dollar, euro, yen, etc. there is no guaranteed purchasing power and the exchange rate floats freely. This leads to volatility where owners of STEEM can unpredictably make or lose money. Beyond speculation, Steem is also a payment system with useful and competitive attributes that are being used by thousands of users and businesses.

# Who are you?

Steem is produced by many of the same developers that created [BitShares](http://bitshares.org), a top 10 crypto currency since November 2013.

# What happens if Steemit, Inc goes out of business?

In the event that Steemit, Inc goes out of business or is unable to maintain steemit.com, the website and all related software will be released under the MIT license. The Steem
community will be free to host alternative wallets.


# How are changes made to the protocol?

The protocol may be changed anytime the majority of block producers agree to make a change. Because 95% of block producers are elected by vesting STEEM holders,
the protocol changes are controlled by stakeholders. The Steem protocol has been designed to have a stable, unchanging protocol. Few if any new protocol features
will be added. There is only one major feature not available on launch: confidential transactions. This feature may be added at a future date to give users some
financial privacy.
