The following schedule is our best estimate of when the software will be mature. All software estimates are
subject to change.

##Phase I - Launch Steem Network Protocol

This phase started on March 24th, 2016 when Steemit, Inc [announced Steem on bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1410943.0). The
first week is the initial allocation via mining. Over the next 3 weeks Steemit will elect 19 block producers from around the world.

##Phase II - Launch of steemit.com Beta (May 2016)

During this phase users miners will start publishing price feeds and the network will be fully operation with the exception of the
referral program and new account signup rewards.  This phase is for early adopters are are more forgiving. Only once steemit.com is
able to make a good first impression will the Beta label be removed.

##Phase III - Launch of steemit.com (June 2016)

During this phase the Steemit website will be functional, but not heavily promoted.

##Phase IV - Public Launch of steemit.com (July 2016)

At this point in time Steemit, Inc will start advertising the signup bonus and referral program and promoting the one-time July 4th
mega-reward for content producers and voters.
